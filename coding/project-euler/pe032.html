    <h2>Problem 32: Pandigital products</h2>
    <p>
      We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once.
      Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital. HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
      Run this solution at repl.io
