    <h2>Problem 44: Pentagon numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk âˆ’ Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?
      Run this solution at repl.io
      <a href="https://repl.it/@DylanBird/PE044-Pentagonal-Numbers">here</a>.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-python">
        #just a guess at this stage
        upper = 10000
        P = [n*(3*n-1)//2 for n in range(1,10*upper+1)]
        # upper bound is half the indices of the pentagonals
        # as we have to sum the numbers together and check if they
        # are pentagonal

        #Easier to search in sets/dicts
        Pdict = {num for num in P}

        minD = P[upper-1]

        data = []

        for i in range(0,upper):
          for j in range(0,upper):
            S = P[i] + P[j]
            D = abs(P[j] - P[i])
            if (S in Pdict) and (D in Pdict):
              data.append([i,j,S,D])
              print([i,j,S,D])

        print(data)

        #Note: Nowhere in my code do I seek to minimise D, instead I have an arbitrary upper limit.
