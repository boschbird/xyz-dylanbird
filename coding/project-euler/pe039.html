    <h2>Problem 39: Integer right triangles</h2>
    <p>
      If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120: <br />
       <br />
      {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}  <br />
       <br />
      For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
