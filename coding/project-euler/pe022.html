    <h2>Problem 22: Names scores</h2>
    <p>
      Using names.txt, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

      For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

      What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

      <code class="language-python">
        #open and read 'names.txt'
        with open('names.txt',"r") as file1:
          #create a single string of all names
          name_string = file1.read()

        #split string into list of names
        namelist = name_string.split('","')
        #"MARY becomes MARY etc. as split function does
        #not deal with the first and last cases
        namelist[0] = 'MARY'
        namelist[-1] = 'ALONSO'

        #sort list of names
        name_sort = sorted(namelist)

        #create dictionary of the alphabet
        #A = 1, B = 2,...

        i = 1
        for letter in alpha:

          i += 1

        name_sum = 0 #sum of letter values in each name
        n = 1 #nth name
        total = 0 #total of letter values TIMES nth name
