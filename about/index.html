    <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a mathematics graduate from the University of Sydney working as a meteorologist in Sydney, soon to be in Melbourne. I didn't study computer science at university and my academic exposure to it was via <em>Matlab</em> and <em>FORTRAN</em> which I both can't stand (why: not open source and really dated respectively). <br />
      I'm really interested in coding, and would love to make some meteorological apps as well as get into some data science too.
