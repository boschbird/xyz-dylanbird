  I have <em>just begun</em> getting back into html and CSS with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/username_zaydek">Zaydek's</a> <em>Scrimbla</em> lesson <a href="https://scrimba.com/g/gbuildablog">"How to build a blog"</a>.
  It is really helpful and technically only takes 43 minutes, but I spent a lot longer trying to understand the code in a bit more depth and commenting the hell out of it. You can find all of that code and other stuff at my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/boschbird">here</a>.

  Also thanks to Mikey for <em>patiently</em> showing me how to <strong>cheaply</strong> register a domain and host content using AWS. You can find his site <a href="https://mikey.battiston.biz">here</a>.
  <strong>This post was both a first post, and a way to practice some basic front-end skills.</strong>
